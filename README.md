Supporting tools for web scrapping

This project is mainly intended to make web scrapping easy. Right now it tries to provide a recommendation on which scrapping tool to use for a URL provided. Current command I use to run:
python3 recommend_scrapping_tool.py
Then enter the url to analyze and get recommendation on which tool to use.
